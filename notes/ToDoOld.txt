-absorb ClipDeletionWatcher int ClipManipulator
-in the top-left corner include a 'Setings' or 'Preferences' button to set up the project and sample-content directories
-display volume in info-line when moving a volume slider (same for the buttons, and pan-stuff)

-MixsonicNewProjectDialog and MixsonicEnterProjectNameDialog are almost identical - we should be able to get rid of one...MixsonicEnterNameDialog is very similar as well

-check if AudioClipComponent really needs to override deleteUnderlyingClip()
-check if AudioClip still needs its copy-constructor
-Track::addClipComponent(bool addAlsoUnderlyingClip), ...same for remove
-move garbageClips to ClipInstantiationManager
